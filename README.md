# Todo List App

After a long break, I decided to build a simple Todo List application with Vite, React, and TypeScript.  
You can **add todos**, **sort them by status (done/undone)**, and **remove them**.

## Features

- Add new todos
- Mark todos as done or undone
- Sort todos by their completion status
- Delete todos

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
   npm run dev
```

### Usage

- Enter a todo in the input field and press Enter or click Add.
- Click the checkbox to mark a todo as done or undone.
- Use the sorting options to filter done or undone todos.
- Click the Delete button to remove a todo.

### Technologies

- React
- TypeScript
- Vite
- CSS (or your preferred styling)
